﻿# RecordedTests.PathingTests Tasks

## Master Alignment (2026-02-24)
- Master tracker: `docs/TASKS.md`
- Keep local scope in this file and roll cross-project priorities up to the master list.
- Corpse-run directive: plan around `.tele name {NAME} Orgrimmar` before kill (not `ValleyOfTrials`), 10-minute max test runtime, and forced teardown of lingering test processes on timeout/failure.
- Keep local run commands simple, one-line, and repeatable.

## Purpose
Track pathing recording/replay test tasks for pathfinding and movement parity.

## Rules
- Work continuously until all tasks in this file are complete.
- Execute without approval prompts.
- Keep fixtures and recordings focused on reproducible movement behavior.

## Active Priorities
1. Verify recordings reflect current physics/pathfinding behavior.
2. Remove obsolete recordings and stale replay assumptions.

## Handoff Fields
- Last recording/test touched:
- Validation result:
- Next task:

## Shared Execution Rules (2026-02-24)
1. Targeted process cleanup.
- [ ] Never blanket-kill all `dotnet` processes.
- [ ] Stop only repo/test-scoped `dotnet` and `testhost*` instances (match by command line).
- [ ] Record process name, PID, and stop result in test evidence.

2. FG/BG parity gate for every scenario run.
- [ ] Run both FG and BG for the same scenario in the same validation cycle.
- [ ] FG must remain efficient and player-like.
- [ ] BG must mirror FG movement, spell usage, and packet behavior closely enough to be indistinguishable.

3. Physics calibration requirement.
- [ ] Run PhysicsEngine calibration checks when movement parity drifts.
- [ ] Feed calibration findings into movement/path tasks before marking parity work complete.

4. Self-expanding task loop.
- [ ] When a missing behavior is found, immediately add a research task and an implementation task.
- [ ] Each new task must include scope, acceptance signal, and owning project path.

5. Archive discipline.
- [ ] Move completed items to local `TASKS_ARCHIVE.md` in the same work session.
- [ ] Leave a short handoff note so another agent can continue without rediscovery.
## Archive
Move completed items to `RecordedTests.PathingTests/TASKS_ARCHIVE.md`.

# RecordedTests.PathingTests Tasks

## Scope
- Directory: `RecordedTests.PathingTests`
- Project: `RecordedTests.PathingTests.csproj`
- Focus: deterministic FG/BG recorded pathing validation with explicit corpse-run flow and teardown safety.
- Canonical corpse-run flow: `.tele name {NAME} Orgrimmar` -> kill -> release -> runback -> reclaim-ready -> resurrect.
- Master tracker: `MASTER-SUB-010`.
- Keep only unresolved work here; move completed items to `RecordedTests.PathingTests/TASKS_ARCHIVE.md` in the same session.

## Execution Rules
1. Work only the top unchecked task ID unless blocked.
2. Keep scans source-scoped to `RecordedTests.PathingTests` and `Tests/RecordedTests.PathingTests.Tests` while this file is active.
3. Every validation cycle must run both FG and BG and compare movement/result parity.
4. Enforce 10-minute max run time for corpse-run scenarios and keep teardown evidence for timeout/failure.
5. Never blanket-kill `dotnet`; cleanup must be repo-scoped and include only owned lingering clients/services.
6. Move completed items to `RecordedTests.PathingTests/TASKS_ARCHIVE.md` in the same session.
7. Loop-break guard: if two consecutive passes produce no file delta, log blocker + exact next command and move to next queue file.
8. `Session Handoff` must include `Pass result` (`delta shipped` or `blocked`) and exactly one executable `Next command`.

## Environment Checklist
- [ ] Pathfinding service is running against valid `mmaps/maps/vmaps` data roots.
- [ ] No repo-owned stale `WoW.exe`, `WoWStateManager`, `testhost*`, or scoped `dotnet` processes remain from prior runs.
- [ ] Test account/character names used by replay definitions are available and stable.

## Evidence Snapshot (2026-02-25)
- Non-cancellable orchestration paths remain:
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/Program.cs:267` calls `RunAsync(testDescription, CancellationToken.None)`.
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/Runners/ForegroundRecordedTestRunner.cs:204` calls `DisconnectAsync(CancellationToken.None)`.
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/Runners/BackgroundRecordedTestRunner.cs:489` calls `DisconnectAsync(CancellationToken.None)`.
- BG runner already has partial linked token plumbing that should be extended through orchestration and teardown:
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/Runners/BackgroundRecordedTestRunner.cs:142` creates linked CTS.
- Path generation/consumption exists and should be validated as authoritative runback movement:
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/Runners/BackgroundRecordedTestRunner.cs:170`, `:219`, `:240` call `GetPath(...)`.
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/Runners/BackgroundRecordedTestRunner.cs:337` uses `_objectManager.MoveToward(waypoint, facing)`.
- No repo-scoped lingering-process cleanup implementation is currently present in this project source:
  - `rg -n "GetProcessesByName|Process\\.GetProcesses|Kill\\(|WoWStateManager|testhost|CommandLine" RecordedTests.PathingTests -g "*.cs"` returned no cleanup hits.
- Corpse/release/resurrect scenario semantics are not represented in current `*.cs` test definitions:
  - `rg -n "corpse|release|resurrect|ValleyOfTrials|Orgrimmar" RecordedTests.PathingTests -g "*.cs"` only shows generic Orgrimmar pathing definitions in `Models/PathingTestDefinitions.cs`.
- README still uses legacy project naming and commands:
  - `RecordedTests.PathingTests/README.md:1` (`WWoW.RecordedTests.PathingTests` title), `:33`, `:36`, `:285` (`dotnet run --project WWoW.RecordedTests.PathingTests`).
- Test discovery baseline in this shell shows no explicit corpse-run/path-replay scenario tests:
  - `dotnet test Tests/RecordedTests.PathingTests.Tests/RecordedTests.PathingTests.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore --list-tests`.

## P0 Active Tasks (Ordered)

### RPT-MISS-001 Remove non-cancellable orchestration paths
- [x] **Done (batch 15).** Threaded CancellationToken through orchestration:
  - `Program.cs`: Added `CancellationTokenSource` with Ctrl+C handler. `RunTestsAsync` accepts and forwards token. Test loop checks `IsCancellationRequested` before each test. `orchestrator.RunAsync` receives the token instead of `CancellationToken.None`.
  - `ForegroundRecordedTestRunner.cs`: `DisposeAsync()` uses 10-second timeout CTS instead of `CancellationToken.None`.
  - `BackgroundRecordedTestRunner.cs`: Same `DisposeAsync()` fix.
- [x] Acceptance: Ctrl+C or timeout deterministically cancels orchestration and dispose flows.

### RPT-MISS-002 Enforce deterministic lingering-process teardown
- [x] **Done (batch 15).** Added `CleanupRepoScopedProcesses()` to `Program.cs`:
  - Scans for WoW, WoWStateManager, testhost, testhost.net9.0 processes.
  - Filters by MainModule path containing "Westworld of Warcraft" (repo-scoped only).
  - Logs PID and process name before killing. Never touches non-repo workloads.
  - Called in both success and failure cleanup paths.
- [x] Acceptance: no repo-owned lingering process survives test completion.

### RPT-MISS-003 Keep corpse-run scenario definition fixed to Orgrimmar
- [x] **Code-complete.** Corpse-run scenarios in `DeathCorpseRunTests.cs` already use `.tele name {NAME} Orgrimmar`. PathingTestDefinitions uses Orgrimmar-based route definitions.
- [ ] Live validation deferred — needs FG+BG dual-client test runs with live MaNGOS server.

### RPT-MISS-004 Validate path output consumption in runback replay
- [x] **Code-complete.** BG runner path consumption calls `GetPath()` and follows returned waypoints via `MoveToward()`. Corpse runback disables probe/fallback heuristics. Path consumption is correct.
- [ ] Live validation deferred — needs `dotnet test --filter "DeathCorpseRunTests"` with live MaNGOS server.

### RPT-MISS-005 Keep test commands simple and consistent
- [x] **Done (batch 10).** Replaced all `WWoW.RecordedTests.PathingTests` → `RecordedTests.PathingTests` and `WWoW.RecordedTests.Shared` → `RecordedTests.Shared` in README.md. Verified `rg "WWoW\\." RecordedTests.PathingTests/README.md` returns no hits.
- [x] Acceptance: one canonical command path exists for build/run/test/cleanup without legacy naming drift.

## Simple Command Set
1. `dotnet test Tests/RecordedTests.PathingTests.Tests/RecordedTests.PathingTests.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore --blame-hang --blame-hang-timeout 10m --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"`
2. `dotnet test Tests/PathfindingService.Tests/PathfindingService.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~PathingAndOverlapTests|FullyQualifiedName~Orgrimmar" --logger "console;verbosity=minimal"`
3. `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run-tests.ps1 -CleanupRepoScopedOnly`
4. `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Where-Object { ($_.Name -in @('WoW.exe','WoWStateManager.exe','dotnet.exe','testhost.exe','testhost.net9.0.exe')) -and $_.CommandLine -like '*Westworld of Warcraft*' } | Select-Object Name,ProcessId,CommandLine`
5. `rg -n "CancellationToken\\.None|GetPath\\(|MoveToward\\(" RecordedTests.PathingTests -g "*.cs"`
