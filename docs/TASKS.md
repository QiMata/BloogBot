# Master Tasks

## Rules
1. **Use ONE continuous session.** Auto-compaction handles context limits.
2. Execute one local `TASKS.md` at a time in queue order.
3. Move completed items to `docs/ARCHIVE.md`.
4. **The MaNGOS server is ALWAYS live.** Never defer live validation tests.
5. **Compare to VMaNGOS server code** when implementing packet-based functionality.
6. Every implementation slice must add or update focused unit tests.
7. After each shipped delta, commit and push before ending the pass.

## P3 - Fishing Parity (Low Priority)

**FishingTask is implemented and passing live validation for both BG and FG.** Remaining work is packet-level optimization, not core mechanics.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 3.1 | Capture FG fishing packets (cast → channel → bobber → custom anim) | Open — packet infra ready |
| 3.2 | Compare BG fishing packets against FG capture | Blocked on 3.1 |
| 3.3 | Harden BG fishing parity to match FG packet/timing | Blocked on 3.2 |

---

## P4 - Movement Flags After Teleport (BT-MOVE-001/002)

ConnectionStateMachine handles MSG_MOVE_TELEPORT/ACK. MovementController.Reset() clears flags to MOVEFLAG_NONE. Remaining: formal FG packet capture test to verify no flag divergence.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 4.1 | Capture FG teleport packets (MSG_MOVE_TELEPORT_ACK → first heartbeats) | Open — packet infra ready |
| 4.2 | Compare BG teleport behavior — identify remaining flag divergence | Blocked on 4.1 |
| 4.3 | Fix any remaining MovementController flag issues found | Blocked on 4.2 |

## P5 - Ragefire Chasm 10-Man Dungeoneering Test

**Goal:** A live integration test that launches 10 bots (1 FG + 9 BG) as a raid group, enters Ragefire Chasm (map 389), and clears the dungeon using coordinated tank/heal/DPS rotations. Validates that the dungeoneering orchestration, group coordination, and class-role combat rotations all work end-to-end.

### Raid Composition

| Slot | Account | Role | Class | Race | Gender | Runner |
|------|---------|------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | TESTBOT1 | Main Tank / Raid Leader | Warrior | Orc | Female | Foreground |
| 2 | RFCBOT2 | Off-Tank | Shaman | Orc | Female | Background |
| 3 | RFCBOT3 | Healer | Druid | Tauren | Male | Background |
| 4 | RFCBOT4 | Healer | Priest | Undead | Male | Background |
| 5 | RFCBOT5 | DPS | Warlock | Undead | Male | Background |
| 6 | RFCBOT6 | DPS | Hunter | Orc | Female | Background |
| 7 | RFCBOT7 | DPS | Rogue | Undead | Female | Background |
| 8 | RFCBOT8 | DPS | Mage | Troll | Male | Background |
| 9 | RFCBOT9 | DPS | Warrior | Orc | Female | Background |
| 10 | RFCBOT10 | DPS | Warrior | Tauren | Female | Background |

*Trope: physical classes (Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, Shaman) = Female; magic classes (Druid, Priest, Warlock, Mage) = Male.*

### Implementation Tasks

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 5.1 | Create MaNGOS accounts (RFCBOT2–RFCBOT10) + GM level 6 via SOAP. Characters auto-created on first bot login, then leveled via `.character level` | **Done** (SOAP) |
| 5.2 | Create `RagefireChasm.settings.json` — 10-bot StateManager config with dungeoneering mode | **Done** (eb3fddd) |
| 5.3 | Restore `DungeoneeringTask` from commit `0e7e0bf` — adapt to current BotRunner architecture (IBotTask, behavior trees, NavigationPath) | **Done** (541a941) |
| 5.4 | Add dungeoneering coordinator to StateManager — group formation, raid conversion, ready check, dungeon entry at RFC portal (1811, -4410, -18) on Kalimdor | **Done** (5a2ae0b) |
| 5.5 | Implement role-aware combat sequences — tank (hold aggro, skull mark), healer (lowest-HP party member), DPS (assist skull target), off-tank (pickup adds) | **Done** (DungeoneeringCoordinator + DungeoneeringTask) |
| 5.6 | Add rest/buff coordination — CanProceed check (all members HP>85%, mana>80%) before pulls | **Done** (541a941, built into DungeoneeringTask) |
| 5.7 | Create `RagefireChasmTests.cs` — test fixture launches StateManager with RFC config, asserts: group formed, dungeon entered (map=389), mobs killed, forward progress | **Done** (eb3fddd) |
| 5.8 | Add dungeon waypoint data for RFC map 389 — encounter positions from `creature` table for mapId=389 | **Done** (541a941, DungeonWaypoints.cs) |

### Key Architecture

- **Test fixture** simply launches StateManager with `RagefireChasm.settings.json` and polls snapshots
- **StateManager** coordinates group formation: FG bot (TESTBOT1) invites all 9 BG bots, converts to raid, sets loot rules, then teleports all to RFC entrance
- **DungeoneeringTask** (restored from `0e7e0bf`) handles in-dungeon behavior: leader navigates waypoints, pulls encounters with skull marks; non-leaders follow leader within 15y
- **BotProfiles** provide class-specific rotations (already exist for Warrior, Warlock, Mage, etc.)
- **MapTransitionGraph** already has RFC portal coordinates: Kalimdor (1811, -4410, -18) ↔ RFC (3, -11, -18)
- **PartyNetworkClientComponent** handles all group/raid operations (invite, accept, convert, ready check)
- **GroupManager** provides role-aware target selection (skull first, heal lowest HP)

## Session Handoff
- **Last updated:** 2026-03-21 (session 125)
- **Branch:** `cpp_physics_system`
- **Completed this session:**
  - **Settings-driven test fixture refactor (f55653a):** Removed COMBATTEST from default config (2-bot: TESTBOT1 FG + TESTBOT2 BG). Created CombatBgBotFixture/CombatFgBotFixture with dedicated collections and settings files. Split CombatLoopTests into CombatBgTests + CombatFgTests + CombatTestHelpers. Moved LootCorpseTests to CombatBg collection. Simplified LiveBotFixture.InitializeAsync — removed zombie cleanup, DB character name seeding, SOAP resolution, clean character state, and stabilization waits. Fixture now just launches StateManager and polls snapshots for InWorld.
  - **ResolveTestSettingsPath shared method:** Extracted settings path resolution from CombatLoopTests and RfcBotFixture into LiveBotFixture base class.
- **Commits:** `f55653a5` (fixture refactor)
- **Test baseline:** BasicLoopTests (2/2), CharacterLifecycleTests, EquipmentEquipTests, VendorBuySellTests, GroupFormationTests all pass. MovementSpeedTests (BG_FlatTerrain_MovesAtExpectedSpeed) fails — BG bot not moving (0 distance, pre-existing). NpcInteractionTests pass individually but fail when run with other tests (state contamination). CombatBg test fails — BG COMBATTEST bot dispatches StartMeleeAttack but doesn't deal damage (HP stays 100/100, pre-existing combat loop issue).
- **Data dirs:** Server reads from `D:/MaNGOS/data/`. VMaNGOS tools at `D:/vmangos-server/`. WoW MPQ at `D:/World of Warcraft/Data/`. Buildings at `D:/World of Warcraft/Buildings/`.
- **Known issues:**
  1. CombatBg: COMBATTEST bot sends StartMeleeAttack but mob HP unchanged (no first hit). Likely BG melee attack sequence not connecting.
  2. FG bot (TESTBOT1) stuck at CharacterSelect in CombatBg fixture — login takes >45s, fixture proceeds without it.
  3. MovementSpeedTests: BG bot moves 0 distance during flat terrain walk test.
  4. Test ordering state contamination: NpcInteraction tests pass individually but fail in batch.
- **Next:**
  1. Fix BG melee combat — StartMeleeAttack dispatches but no damage dealt
  2. Investigate FG bot CharacterSelect stuck in CombatBg fixture (longer timeout or login sequence issue)
  3. Fix MovementSpeedTests — BG bot not moving
  4. P3/P4: FG packet capture tests (fishing parity, teleport flags)
