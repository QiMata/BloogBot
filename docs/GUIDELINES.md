# AI Documentation Rules

- Before asking for clarification, search existing docs.
- Update docs if:
  - A new command is added to build/run workflow.
  - A new class of behavior scripts (e.g., QuestAI, CombatAI) is introduced.
  - A dependency is added to C++ or C# projects.
  - Database schema migrations are created.
- Never overwrite existing docs — append with date + version.


# toolbox

- Use Toolbox tools before guessing schema
- Update docs when adding new tools, build steps, or DB schema changes
